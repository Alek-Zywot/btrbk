btrbk-current

  * Bugfix: fix sorting of dates in schedule().
  * Bugfix: correct parsing of btrfs subvolume list (closes: #28).

btrbk-0.19.2

  * Bugfix: fix crash when using btrfs-progs < 3.17.3 (closes: #24).

btrbk-0.19.1

  * Use "cgen" for snapshot comparison.
  * Bugfix: fix crash in summary display (closes: #22).

btrbk-0.19.0

  * Added "snapshot_create onchange", which skips snapshot creation if
    the latest snapshot is up-to-date (i.e. has same generation as the
    source subvolume).
  * Improved handling of command line subvolume filter for "run",
    "dryrun" and "tree" actions (closes: #21).
  * Bugfix: fixed crash in action "diff".

btrbk-0.18.0

  * MIGRATION
    - update ssh_filter_btrbk.sh on all remote hosts
    - update configuration file (/etc/btrbk/btrbk.conf):
      - "snapshot_create_always yes" -> "snapshot_create always"
      - "snapshot_create_always no"  -> "snapshot_create ondemand"
  * Set PATH variable instead of using absolute "/sbin/btrfs" for
    compatibility with all linux distros out there, which all install
    'btrfs' in different locations (closes: #20).
  * Added configuration option "snapshot_create", replacing option
    "snapshot_create_always". This allows setups with multiple btrbk
    instances on several hosts (closes: #18).
  * Added command line option -r (resume only).
  * Catch and display errors from "btrfs subvolume show".
  * Include systemd service and timer unit for daily backups.

btrbk-0.17.1

  * Bugfix: send/receive: delete possibly left-behind garbled
    subvolume on failure. Fail with unrecoverable error if stray
    target subvolume is in the way (closes: #17).
  * Bugfix: assume unreachable target as clean on snapshot creation if
    snapshot_create_always is set (closes: #19).

btrbk-0.17.0

  * New versioning scheme using more common three-level versions.
  * Code refactoring: cleanup of data structures and handling of btrfs
    subvolume tree, as well as security related code parts.
  * Correct handling of symlinks to btrfs subvolumes (closes: #12).
  * Added configuration option "snapshot_name" (closes: #5).
  * Log messages now go to stderr, only the summary is printed on
    stdout.
  * Bugfix: allow "0" as subvolume name (closes: #10).
  * Bugfix: allow "/" as volume name (closes: #15).
  * Bugfix: check source AND targets for determining snapshot postfix
    (closes: #11).
  * Bugfix: fixed "diff" action (colses: #14).
  * Allow '+' character for subvolume names.
  * Filesystems on remote hosts are now printed as
    "{my.remote-host.com}" in summary and logs.

btrbk-0.16

  * Bugfix: correctly check retention policy for missing backups.

btrbk-0.15

  * Added configuration option "btrfs_progs_compat", to be enabled if
    using btrfs-progs < 3.17 (closes: #6).
  * Added configuration option "resume_missing", for automatic resume
    of missing backups (closes: #8).
  * Removed configuration option "receive_log" in favor of printing
    errors from "btrfs receive".
  * Bugfix: show correct exit code on external command failure.
  * Bugfix: no crash if "commit_delete" option is set to "no"

btrbk-0.14

  * Bugfix: correctly handle empty target subvolumes (blocker for all
    new users; closes: #4).

btrbk-0.13

  * Bugfix: allow '@' character for subvolume names (blocker for
    ubuntu users, since ubuntu prefixes all subvolumes with '@' in its
    subvolume layout; closes: #3).

btrbk-0.12

  * Cleaner and more generic parsing of btrfs subvolume list.
  * Bugfix: subvolumes are also allowed for "snapshot_dir" (closes:
    #1, #2).

btrbk-0.11
